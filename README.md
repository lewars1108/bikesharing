## Summary

In conclusion, bikesharing tends to be more popular in metropolitan areas. In the analysis, Manhattan had the top starting locations for bike sharing. It can be inferred that cities, or more populated areas, are more likely to use a bikesharing service. The investors will need to be assured that availabilty of bikes will be abundant in the more trafficked areas of Des Moines. 

In 2019 NYC recorded a population of 8.4 million, while Des Moines had about 216,000. Our bikesharing service needs to push for more subscriptions to account for the drastic difference in population size for standard customers. The overall numbers will look drastically different, but the peak hours should be similar.
